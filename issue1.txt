Okay now  lets learn internal flow, say during running I am getting autentication failure dur to sync fail, what could be the flow and issue


Great — let’s dig into the internal flow of the Authentication Failure due to sync failure in the context of OAI UE and 4G EPC (MME + HSS). This issue usually points to AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement) failure caused by mismatched sequence numbers between UE and HSS.

🔁 Context: 4G AKA Flow (EPS-AKA)
UE → eNodeB → MME: Attach Request (with IMSI)

MME ↔ HSS: Send Authentication Info Request (AIR), gets back a vector from HSS

MME → UE: NAS Authentication Request (includes RAND, AUTN)

UE computes RES using:

RAND

AUTN (XOR’ed with SQN)

UE key from USIM/emulated key store

If UE detects that the SQN is not within the expected range, it sends:

Authentication Failure (cause: synch failure)

Includes AUTS to help HSS resync

🔍 Internal Flow and Code Locations (OAI)
🔸 OAI UE Side:
File: openair3/NAS/UE/EMM/Service/emm_fsm.c, AuthenticationResponse.c, AuthenticationFailure.c

Trigger: UE gets AUTN from MME and checks sequence number (SQN)

If SQN is outside allowed window → generates AUTS and sends Authentication Failure

🔸 OAI MME Side:
File: openairCN/SRC/NAS/EMM/Authentication.c

Receives Authentication Failure with AUTS

MME forwards this to HSS via another Authentication Info Request (AIR) with resyncInfo

HSS uses AUTS to compute correct SQN and returns a new vector

MME retries Authentication Request

❗ Root Causes of Sync Failure
Cause	Description
❌ Mismatched SQN	UE and HSS are not aligned on SQN; could be due to reuse of old auth vector or out-of-sync USIM state
🔁 Replay Attack Prevention	UE rejects reused AUTN (with old SQN)
🧪 Hardcoded Keys	If UE uses emulated USIM (e.g., hardcoded K/OPC) and mismatch occurs
🔄 No resync handled	HSS or MME not handling resync properly
🧱 Missing/incorrect AUTS handling	If UE fails to generate correct AUTS or MME fails to forward it

🧪 Debugging Steps
✅ 1. Verify UE Key Config:
In UE config file:

USIM:
  imsi: "001010123456789"
  key: "8baf473f2f8fd09487cccbd7097c6862"
  opc: "e734f8734007d6c5ce7a0508809e7e9c"
Ensure same IMSI/key/OPC is provisioned in HSS subscriber database.

✅ 2. Enable Detailed Logs:
In OAI UE:

--log_verbosity level --ninja -d
Watch for logs like:

EMM: Authentication Failure (Cause: Synchronization Failure)
Sending AUTS...
In MME logs:

Received Authentication Failure with AUTS
Resync requested from HSS
✅ 3. Check HSS Handling:
In openair-cn HSS, verify:

HandleResync is implemented

AUTS is correctly parsed

New vector is generated on resync

✅ 4. Force Vector Refresh in HSS DB (if persistent issue):
If it always fails, clear old auth vectors:

DELETE FROM `eps_authentication_vectors` WHERE imsi='001010123456789';
Then restart MME and UE.

For IMS : you need to first go to IMS server to add details for IMSI

✅ Summary Fix Flow
UE detects SQN mismatch → Sends Authentication Failure + AUTS
↓
MME sends resyncInfo to HSS
↓
HSS recalculates SQN and returns new vector
↓
MME sends new Authentication Request
↓
UE proceeds with correct RES → Authentication Success
