APN and IMSI are both critical in mobile networking, but they serve completely different purposes.

🔍 Difference Between APN and IMSI
Feature			IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)			APN (Access Point Name)
Purpose	Uniquely 	identifies a subscriber (SIM card) in the mobile network	Identifies the data service or external network the UE wants to connect to
Who uses it?		Core Network uses it to authenticate the user (via HSS/UDM)	Core Network uses it to route traffic to the right service or network
Format			Numeric (e.g., 001010000000803)					Textual (e.g., internet, ims, mms)
Where is it stored?	In the SIM card (USIM)						In the UE config or negotiated during session
When is it used?	During registration/attach phase (for authentication)		During PDN session setup (for data access)
Example			001010000000803 (MCC=001, MNC=01, MSIN=000000803)		ims or internet.mnc001.mcc001.gprs

📱 IMSI – Think of it as:
Your phone number's DNA — a permanent ID in your SIM that tells the network who you are.

Format:

IMSI = MCC + MNC + MSIN
      = 3 digits + 2–3 digits + remaining digits
Example:

00101 = MCC 001, MNC 01 (Test network)

000000803 = MSIN (subscriber-specific)

🌐 APN – Think of it as:
The “access gateway” — the kind of internet service you're asking for (internet, IMS, enterprise VPN, etc.)

Examples:

internet → for regular data

ims → for VoLTE / IMS SIP signaling

enterprise.apn → for corporate/private network access

🧩 Summary
You want to...	What you need
Identify the user/subscriber	IMSI
Connect to a type of data service	APN
