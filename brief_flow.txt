🛰️ 4G Message Flow in OAI UE Simulator (Typical Attach and Data Session):
Let's go through the message flow layer by layer (RRC + NAS):

🟦 1. RRC Connection Setup (RAN Level - UE <-> eNodeB):
UE Simulator	eNodeB
RRC Connection Request	← UE initiates connection (Random Access).
RRC Connection Setup	→ eNB allocates resources and sends config.
RRC Connection Setup Complete	← UE sends back setup complete.

🟨 2. NAS Attach Procedure (Core Level - UE <-> MME):
UE Simulator	MME
Attach Request (NAS)	← Includes IMSI, UE capabilities, etc.
Authentication Request	→ From MME via eNB (challenge).
Authentication Response	← UE sends response (based on key).
Security Mode Command	→ To start NAS encryption/integrity.
Security Mode Complete	← Acknowledges security context setup.
Attach Accept	→ MME accepts and assigns GUTI.
Attach Complete	← UE acknowledges.

Behind the scenes: MME interacts with HSS for IMSI → Authentication, and SGW/PGW to allocate an IP.

🟩 3. ESM (Session Management) - Bearer Setup:
UE Simulator	MME + SGW/PGW
Create Session Request	→ MME asks PGW to create default bearer.
Create Session Response	← PGW responds with IP, bearer info.
Initial Context Setup	→ MME instructs eNB to setup DRB.
Default Bearer Activation	← UE is informed of IP and bearer.

📡 4. Data Transfer (IP layer):
Once the bearer is up:

UE can ping the remote IPs.

UE can run iperf to test throughput.

IP packets are tunneled through GTP-U over S1-U interface.

🧪 Use Cases of UE Simulator:
Test eNodeB under controlled conditions.

Core network protocol stack testing.

Load testing multiple UEs (mass attach/detach).

Debugging issues in NAS, RRC, and bearer procedures.

🔁 Summary Flow Diagram (Simplified):
[UE Sim] → RRC Req → [eNB]
        ← RRC Setup ←
        → RRC Comp →
        → Attach Req (NAS) →
            → Auth Req →
            ← Auth Res ←
            → Sec Mode Cmd →
            ← Sec Mode Comp ←
            → Attach Accept →
            ← Attach Complete ←
        → Bearer Setup → [MME + SGW/PGW]
        ← Bearer Accept ←
        → IP Data (ping/iperf) →
